# Hivemind

### Project

Hivemind is a project just for fun, it is a social media site with a few caveats. I got the idea for these caveats after reading a book. I won't give too much away just yet. 

I hate CSS and Bulma and Bootstrap all look alike. I will be using ChatGPT for all CSS development because why waste time doing something I don't enjoy all while trying to do a project just for fun??

All JS, Python, and most HTML will be done without the help of any AI whatsoever though. 

I am not a developer, this will eventually be impressive but for the forseeable future this will be a simple social media site with basic CRUD operations. A Like button will probably be the most difficult thing that I do here. Other than the caviats which I will not mention. 

### Progress
As of right now this is unusable and does not even have authentication worked out yet
